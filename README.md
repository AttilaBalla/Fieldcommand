## Fieldcommand ##

Fieldcommand is a development manager & mod portal site with the focus of providing the newest versions and updates to our small but loyal ROTR community.

This repository contains the backend part of the project, the frontend React app can be found here: https://github.com/AttilaBalla/Fieldcommand_frontend

FC will be paired with a desktop client that automates the process of downloading, installing and switching between different versions. 

Players can use the website to provide feedback in the form of game reports, enabling us to discover and react to cool or cheesy games and shape our next versions based on them. Mod developers may have an account to access the game reports and also manage and upload their releases to make them available for the client.
