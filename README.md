## Fieldcommand ##

Fieldcommand is a development manager website with the focus of providing the newest versions and updates to our small but loyal ROTR community.

It will be paired with a desktop client that automates the process of downloading, installing and switching between different versions. 

Players can use the website to provide feedback in the form of game reports, enabling us to discover and react to cool or cheesy games and shape our next versions based on them. Mod developers may have an account to access the game reports and also manage and upload their releases to make them available for the client.

FC aims to provide fan made releases presently but official versions may also be available for download.
