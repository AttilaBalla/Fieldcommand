# Fieldcommand

Fieldcommand is a development manager website with the focus of providing the newest versions and updates to our small but loyal ROTR community.

With the help of the client it's possible to automatically recieve and switch between different versions without having to manually move files around.

Players can also provide feedback in the form of game reports, enabling us to discover and react to cool or cheesy games and shape our next versions based on them. It aims to provide fan made releases presently but official versions may also be available for download.
